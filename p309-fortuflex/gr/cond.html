Store reserves the right to cancel fraudulent, false or speculative orders as well as those orders that have been requested by a customer with which there may be a difference / controversy in previous orders, or when there are reasonable doubts that may suggest that the Customer is violating any of the specified purchase conditions or is participating in any criminal activity.

Store may modify at any time these general conditions of sale, adapting them to the legal and economic circumstances of the moment. The user can always check the updated version of this text by clicking on the "General Purchase Conditions" links.

Store does not recognize deviations from these general conditions of sale. In case of deviations from the general conditions of sale, these may only be an integral part of the contract exceptionally, when Store has expressly recognized them in writing.

By using this website, the user is bound to these conditions so we recommend that they be read carefully. If the user does not agree with these conditions, they must leave the website. </p>

		<h2>Use of the website</h2>
		<p>The page of this Web site is of public access, free and free.

The user must make use of the Web in accordance with the Law, good customs, morality and public order.

Store can not assume any responsibility that derives from the misuse, misuse, incorrect or illegal of the Web and / or its content. Nor will it assume any responsibility for the connection problems or viruses that may arise as a result of the intrinsic risks of the connection and the Internet browsing.

The user voluntarily accesses this website. The access and navigation on this website implies accepting and knowing the legal warnings, conditions and terms of use contained therein.

The mere access does not imply the establishment of any kind of commercial relationship between Store and the user. There will be no contract between the user and Store in relation to any product until the order has been validated and processed.

Store reserves the right to modify the conditions of access and the content of the Web when it deems convenient and without prior notice. </p>
		<h2>Obligations of the user</h2>

It is essential that the user provides all the information that is cataloged as mandatory on the website, since, if they do not do so, they will not be able to process their order. Store will not be responsible in any case for possible delays or failures in delivery as a result of the error or omission of this data.</p>

		<h2>Information and availability of products: </h2>
		<p>The photographs and descriptions of the products provided on the website are indicative information. It is intended to offer users the maximum accuracy and reliability of the information detailed on the website (names, properties of products, photographs, etc.), but Store is not responsible for potential errors that may exist, such as accuracy of colors and shades.

Store is not responsible for the veracity and accuracy of the information on the products offered on the website that third parties or companies may have disclosed by other means, whether electronic or not, and that appeared on other websites than the present .

The products presented on the web are always subject to availability. Store will ensure that the advertised products are in stock. However, the online store can not be responsible for the lack of delivery if, in some exceptional case, the order is not available for any reason. In this case, the customer may choose to replace the product or return the payment.

Also, although Store will do everything possible to always process all orders, there may be exceptional circumstances that require it to reject the processing of an order after having sent the Order Confirmation, so it reserves the right to do so in at any time, in its sole discretion, when the following circumstances occur:

- there was a technical or price error on the website when the order was placed

- the requested product is out of stock or not available

- information provided by the incomplete, incorrect or fraudulent client regarding the identity, age, payment details, billing information and / or shipping address

- security systems indicate that the order is anomalous or fraudulent

- there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is an intention to resell the products

- it has not been possible, after 3 attempts, to deliver the order at the address provided

- due to a force majeure event (see below) </p>

		<h2>Purchase procedure: </h2>
		<p>The user will be able to browse the website and access a wide catalog of the products offered, in which clicking on the product in question will access a tab that will provide all the commercial and technical information available about the product, as well as its availability in stock and in colors, if applicable.

To formalize the purchase through the website, the user can enter their data without having to create a user account; except in the case that the purchase will be formalized by means of a credit card for which the user will be required to register on the website and create a user account.

6. Accept the purchase conditions

7. Confirm the order by making the payment.

Once the order has been validated and confirmed, Store will acknowledge receipt of the order by sending a confirmation email that will be sent to the customer immediately, or in any case within a maximum period of 24 hours, indicating the order number and state of it. </p>
