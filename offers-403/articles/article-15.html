          Active recreation is basically recreational physical activity undertaken in presence of other
          people, in the absence of structured competition. It's a broad category of activities over the
          broader range of activity choices that include active outdoor living, active transportation, and
          sports. These include hiking, climbing, running, cycling, fishing, swimming, martial arts,
          aerobics, surfing, mountaineering, mountain biking, ka yaking/surfing, mountain climbing,
          rafting, snorkeling, boating, aerobics, dance, martial arts, gymnastics, and even rock climbing.
          A lot of these activities may seem to be out of place in the case of active recreation. But then
          again, recreation isn't all about sports either. Some forms of exercise are also part and parcel
          of recreational activities.</p>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Yoga, for example, is an example of a leisure-time activity that enhances the mind and the
          body. This has been practiced by some cultures as an art form. Yoga involves concentration on
          breath, postures, meditation, relaxation, and concentration. This results in physical health,
          including strength, stamina, and flexibility. Various other health benefits resulting from yoga
          include stress reduction, increased immune function, better blood circulation, lower
          cholesterol, and enhanced mental awareness.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Another form of active recreation is horseback riding and skiing. Both of them are types of
          leisure-time activities and both of them have significant health benefits. The former improves
          cardiovascular function, enhances lung capacity, and strengthens the heart. The latter
          improves posture, balance, and gait.

        </p>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          The third major category of recreational activities is total-body conditioning and
          rehabilitation. It deals with physical activities that help you keep fit and healthy. These include
          activities like running, walking, hiking, cycling, rowing, aerobics, dancing, gymnastics,
          swimming, and weightlifting. A major benefit of this type of recreation is that it provide s a
          healthy way of life.

        </p>

        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Sports recreation is the fourth type of active recreation, and it refers to activities like sports
          and fitness activities. There are many types of sports recreation: team sports, recreational
          sports, individual sports, ice fishing, swimming, tennis, golf, soccer, basketball, tennis, and
          bowling. A major benefit of these sports is that they improve your general well-being and help
          you burn excess calories and lose weight.
        </p>

        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Some of the most popular active recreational physical activiti es include bicycling, kayaking,
          skiing, hiking, dog walking, mountain biking, fishing, and tennis. All these activities have been
          featured in numerous movies, books, television shows, and musicals. There is even a popular
          children's cartoon called Ice Age. Active recreation has a very low fat and high protein diet.
          Therefore, it can be used as a weight loss strategy.
        </p>

        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Another excellent active recreation activity is martial arts and karate. In fact, there are more
          martial arts styles and disciplines than there are practitioners of these fighting styles. Most
          martial arts provide a good exercise routine because the techniques require lots of muscular
          strength, balance, and flexibility. The martial arts include Kung Fu, Tae kwon do, Goju -Ryu,
          boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts. Among these styles, the most popular ones are Wing
          Chun, Judo, Jujutsu, Kenpo, Shaolin, and Russian Sambo.

        </p>

        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          Apart from these, there are also several other activities such as bicycling, hiking, fishing,
          horseback riding, golfing, swimming, tennis, and dancing. Most of these activities are
          considered a leisure time physical activity undertaken outdoors. Many of these activities are
          found to be enjoyable by all ages and especially by children. If you have any queries on the
          different recreational activities available in town, you can ask for help at local recreation
          centers or get professional advice from fitness experts.

        </p>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          A few other options include biking, kayaking, canoeing, whitewater rafting, mountain climbing,
          parasailing, rock climbing, nature watching, serene aerobic workouts, white water rafting, or
          simply taking a walk. Some people prefer to engage in aerobic exercises such as walking,
          jogging, running, or jogging outdoors, while others prefer outdoor cyclin g, kayaking, hiking,
          and kayaking. Yoga can also be considered as a gentle yoga flow.

        </p>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          An active recreation and fitness program do not need to be just about fitness. The leisure time
          physical activity economy includes sports and games like horseback riding, hiking, geocaching,
          fly fishing, boating, hiking, kayaking, canoeing, white water rafting, mountain biking, rowing,
          tennis, racquetball, badminton, soccer, badminton, basketball, and badminton. Some of these
          sports can be included along with yoga classes in an active recreation and fitness program.
          These activities, along with yoga, increase a person's flexibility and improve muscle tone. It is
          the goal of an active recreation and fitness program to get fit, both through aerobic exercise
          and milder forms of movement. This goal is in addition to reaching physical fitness goals.
        </p>
        <p class="article-content__paragraph">
          There are many types of sports activities. Some of these sports include golf, tennis, badminton,
          soccer, tennis, basketball, badminton, hunting, hiking, fishing, mountaineering, kayak ing,
          skiing, snowboarding, sledding, surfing, sailing, wind surfing, snowshoeing, inline skating, ice
          skating, rollerblading, inline hockey, and much more. Some sports can be enjoyed alone, some
          can be enjoyed with friends, and some require that you partic ipate in competitions. Some
          activities can even be done by children and parents.
