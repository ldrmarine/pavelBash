                <p>They are making accusations that it causes people to get ripped and gain muscle too quickly and
                    should be regulated, despite the fact that it’s clinically proven to be safe and has none of the
                    dangerous side effects that real steroids have.</p>

                <p>Since the products were recently featured on TV, we have been getting 1000’s of emails
                    daily from our readers, begging us for more information and asking us
                    how they can get their hands on this new muscle-building supplement.
                    Surprisingly, many men who struggle daily with their bodies have yet to
                    hear about this powerful option.</p>
                <p class="quote">Trainers call this new supplement stack "nature's steroid alternative" which lets
                    you build muscle and boost sex drive</p>
                <p>In confidential interviews with HR365, Hollywood movie-stars are crediting the product with
                    helping them build muscle and put on lean muscle in preparation for movie roles. Dozens of other
                    celebrities have all transformed their bodies using this controversial pill. Even professional
                    athletes have gotten in on the muscle-building action and used the same product to make some
                    drastic physical transformations.</p>
                <p>The product we're talking about is called <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>. You may have seen it in the news, on TV, or trending online as the safe and
                    powerful "secret muscle trick” being used by male models, celebrities and regular folk all
                    across the UK. The main ingredient is Zinc Citrate, which is a rare compound the body uses to
                    build muscle quickly. Zinc Citrate converts to Nitric Oxide (NO) which causes the vasodilation
                    of your blood vessels. In other words, it drastically increases the amount of nutrients that can
                    be sent to your muscles. Eternal Nutrition Muscle’s high Zinc Citrate content and other muscle building
                    properties make it a powerful tool to transform your body.</p>

                <p class="text-center" style="font-size:12px;">The rare Zinc Citrate compound converts to
                    Nitroc Oxide (NO) to dilate your blood vessels and increase the amount
                    of nutrients your muscles receive.</p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> is so effective you'll see why it
                    deserves a Special Report. But maybe the most important part is that
                    Eternal Nutrition Muscle is available WITHOUT a prescription.</p>
                <img src="images/doctors.jpg" width="800" class="img-fluid" alt="Alt text">
                <p class="text-center" style="font-size:12px;">The ingredients in

                    have been clinically proven to increase muscle-building without dieting or exercise.</p>
                <p>According to Doctors conducting a clinical study -
                    the combo works in more than one way, “The first way is it goes in and causes blood vessels
                    in the muscle to dilate and expand…</p>
                <p>The second way, the most important way, is it boosts your natural testosterone levels
                    and lean muscle building abilities. So now you have increased testosterone in the blood stream,
                    helping you build muscle at an increased rate.
                    You get this synergistic effect that basically gets you ripped while increasing
                    the production of new muscle. But it's completely natural and safe.”</p>

                <p class="text-center" style="font-size:12px;">One blogger from Leeds transformed his body in just 9
                    weeks using <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>.</p>
                <p>If you’re feeling skeptical right now, you’re not alone. We here at
                    HR365 have seen many promising products come and go over the last 18 years.
                    When we first learned about ‘yet another’ muscle-building product our fad radar went
                    off right away. Even after pouring through mountains of research...I had an educated opinion.
                    But, I still had no personal proof that <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>
                    was worth the time.
                    So, with my editor's blessing, I decided to go out and put the product to the test myself.
                    What better way to find out the truth than to conduct my own study?</p>
                <p>We know that the thought of getting ripped and building lean muscle often
                    feels like an impossible challenge. We’ve evaluated numerous muscle-building programs
                    and it seems like everything is too demanding or doesn’t work as claimed.
                    The reason why most programs fail is because they impose unrealistic restrictions
                    on your daily life.</p>

                        <p>After 1 week on the new routine, I was surprised by how fast and dramatic
                            the effects were. My energy level was up and I wasn't as hungry as
                            I usually was. This is a welcomed side effect of
                            <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> and its power to curb
                            appetite.
                            I honestly felt fantastic and best of all, I didn't have to
                            change anything about my daily routine.</p>
                        <p>On Day 7, I got on the scale (this new digital scale that measures muscle composition)
                            and couldn't believe my eyes--I had gained 3 pounds of muscle mass.
                            But still I wasn't completely convinced. They say that in the beginning
                            of some muscle programs, you lose a lot of water weight and gain a lot of muscle.
                            I wanted to see if I would still gain this much muscle in the upcoming weeks.
                            But it sure was looking up! I now weighed under 12 stone for the first time in years!

                        <p>After 2 weeks of using the supplement I had more energy and
                            was sleeping more soundly than ever. I wasn't waking up in the middle
                            of the night or tossing and turning because my body was able to relax
                            (a result of the supplements' detoxifying properties, I think).
                            I also managed to shred down, putting me at an unbelievable 11 stone in just 2 weeks.
                            I could also feel a 6-pack coming through, which my girlfriend loved. Hell yeah!</p>
                        <p>At this point I started to put more faith in these muscle products as
                            more than just a gimmick.</p>

                            I had gained almost 1 stone of pure muscle and trimmed down a lot.
                            All the "love handles" on the sides of my stomach were completely gone.
                            My stomach was so defined I finally had a 6-pack! This product is amazing.

                        <p>I still had a lot of energy as well. Usually around the third week of other diets
                            you tend to run out of steam. But with <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>
                            my energy levels didn't dip. Instead, they remained steady throughout
                            the day! I even noticed that my stomach was digesting food better,
                            no bloating or embarrassing gas after I ate.</p>

                    out there are shams &amp; flops. I went ahead and ordered the exact brands you recommended on
                    this article, and I can't wait to try it. </p>

                <p> I've been seeing the Eternal Nutrition Muscle combo all over also. I even heard my best friend talking
                    about this muscle supplements a few days ago since one of his friends put on like 13 pounds of
                    muscle in the first 15 days! I definitely have to try this, thanks dude!.</p>

                <p> This stuff is amazing! My best friend James did the same combo and lost an incredible amount of
                    weight and it super buff now.. i couldn't believe it and had to do some research on my own which
                    is how I found this news article. I can't believe they are offering trial bottles! I know James
                    spent something like £300 and was thrilled.. imagine how excited he would be if it cost her
                    under £4. This is a unreal, thanks so much mate!! </p>

                <p>This sound pretty easy to do, I already work out so i guess a little help won't hurt, this is a
                    great opportunity to try it</p>

                <p> A friend of mine did the Eternal Nutrition Muscle and recommended it to me 3 weeks ago. I ordered the
                    products and received them within 3 days (although I didn't get the discounted shipping). The
                    results have been incredible and I can't wait to see what weeks 3 and 4 bring </p>

                <p> stand by this combo. I tried this diet a months ago and I can't say enough about it. This combo
                    helped me gain 1 stone 4 pounds of muscle and it completely changed my life. (I have always been
                    a skinny twig). I highly recommend this diet to ANYONE that's looking to put on seriously muscle
                    FAST. </p>

                <p> I ordered the limited trial a few weeks ago and the customer service for these companies are
                    excellent. Will continue to buy from them.. and yes the muscle diet works like a miracle! :)

                <p> Thank you Bryan and HR365 for doing a report on this muscle building product. I've seen the
                    advertisements everywhere and I didn't have the courage to try it until now. Thank you. </p>
