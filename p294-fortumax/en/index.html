<h1>NEW EXCLUSIVE: </h1>
<h3>DWAYNE JOHNSON KICKED OFF SET OF BALLERS AFTER STUDIO BANS USE OF "PROHIBITED SUBSTANCE"</h3>
<p class="meta">By <span>Adam Pischner</span></p>
<img src="images/logos.png" alt> <a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/08a60b0ca4673.jpg" alt></a>
<p class="cap">“If I had this back when I was younger, I could have
spent way more time vacationing &amp; less time in the gym &amp;
planning meals.” - Dwayne Johnson</p>
<br>
<p>(CNN)- After HBO announced the early termination of The Rock's contract for the popular television series, Ballers, The Rock held a press conference to tell his side of the story.
</p>
<p>
Dwayne Johnson, the 45 year-old superstar wrestler-turned-actor, claims that he did nothing wrong, and that the network's new PED testing policy still has some major issues to resolve. The Rock stated that "it was all a big misunderstanding" after HBO president, Michael Lombardo, confirmed earlier this year that the substance would not be covered by the network's injury insurance for actors.
</p>
<p>HBO started a probe earlier this year into what regimens and supplements professional actors were using that were getting them so fit for the big screen in the short time between movies.</p>
<p>Dwayne assured the media that he doesn't take any illegal drugs, and that his routine consists entirely of perfectly legal supplements that all leading actors are taking when they need to quickly get into shape for a role.</p>
<p>Shortly after his announcement, we were able to get an interview with the man himself to find out more on his response to the studio's allegations.</p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/db2472165417.jpg" alt></a>
<p>As shocking as this story is, there’s more...</p>
<p>The Rock is in great shape, both physically and mentally. While many assumed he achieved his size and strength performance due to traditional training methods and supplements, there is apparently more than meets the eye. He admitted to taking a particular supplement when he needs to quickly get into shape before starting a new role.</p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/e97810323692.jpg"></a>
<p>"Before you judge, this is 100% natural" Johnson defended. </p>
<p> When we asked if he thought taking the supplement was dishonest and misleading, Dwayne laughed.</p>
<p> "First of all everyone is using this, I mean everybody, not just actors in Hollywood but in all the major sports out there. It's completely fine, because its not illegal and contains no drugs. This is the real deal. The ultimate performance enhancer." said a grinning Johnson. "Whether you're an actor or not, any man of any age can absolutely without a doubt benefit from using taking this daily." </p>
<p> "I feel great, I am in the best shape of my life, and my mind is clearer than ever. I've never been able lift so much and my energy levels are incredible, I feel like superman!", he laughed. </p>
<p>The popular supplement designed to burn fat, pack on muscle, skyrocket energy and stamina is called <a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> It is a common product taken by many athletes, but it is under consideration of being banned by all major league sports organizations for two reasons: </p>
<p><strong>1. This supplement has been proven to boost muscle growth rate by an average of a 150%! This would make an athlete like Dwayne Johnson stronger than "any athlete in any sport".</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. These supplements don't have to be used in conjunction with a gym. Users experience massive muscle growth and fat loss without lifting a single weight. Many athletic commissions across the globe consider this natural trick to be a "cheat" as it requires hardly any effort on the user's part. </strong></p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/f57c280f9db7.jpg"></a>
<p>After Dwayne Johnson's statement about <a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank">Eternal Nutrition Muscle </a> went viral , Fox News received thousands of emails from our readers. In an attempt to answer our reader's questions and to discover just how much <a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> has benefited Dwayne Johnson we decided to test it ourselves in an exclusive Fox News case study.</p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/dadbodoz.jpg"></a>
<p class="cap">“It’s an online community that is able to increase muscle mass by 400% with no gym.” -Dr. Oz</p>
<h2>THIS VIRAL MOVEMENT INCLUDES MEN OF ALL AGES GETTING RIPPED... FAST!</h2>
<p>They're calling it the <strong>“War Against The Dad Bod.”</strong> Millions of Dads are coming together to build muscle like never before
&amp; decreasing their fat to muscle ratios while improving their
overall health. Many of them are taking it a step further &amp; getting
ripped bodies in weeks. In a Special Report released this week, Dr. Oz
calls the viral internet movement <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">“the most widespread trend in health science for men.”</a></p>
<p>This movement was sparked by a 10 year long study published last
month. Researchers at Harvard Medical School determined the true
consequences of low muscle mass. The study’s findings boil down to two
parts: First, <strong>93% of American men over 40 do not have healthy
levels of muscle mass, &amp; second, fat to muscle ratio is the most
important factor for determining health in men over 40</strong>. High
fat &amp; low muscle ratios result in numerous health problems,
including mental illness, low libido, ED, fatigue, &amp; depression.</p>
<p>Since the study was released to the public a revolutionary new product has been sweeping the country! It's called <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> &amp; it's been featured on virtually every mainstream media outlet you can think of.</p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/drphil.jpg"></a>
<p class="cap">“This online community is systematically destroying the "Dad-Bod". I've started using <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> &amp; I've lost 6 pounds in a week without any dietary or lifestyle changes.” -Dr. Phil</p>
<h2>MEN AROUND THE WORLD ARE COMING TOGETHER IN THE WAR AGAINST HIGH BODY FAT &amp; LOW MUSCLE MASS. ARE YOU NEXT?</h2>
<p>As I researched the movement in depth, it became obvious what was at its core. It was a revolutionary new supplement called <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>.
It’s an exclusive blend of natural ingredients from Italy, Southeast
Asia, Paraguay, &amp; Botswana, that result in incredible
transformations to ones physique.</p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/dadbod2.jpg"></a>
<p class="cap">“The Dad-Bod is not muscular, it’s not strong, &amp;
it’s not healthy. It’s the enemy of billions of men around the world who
don’t have time to spend at the gym or eat meticulously planned diets.”
- Rafael Perez (above)</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px;"><a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> UNIQUE INGREDIENTS:</h2>
<div class="ingredients">
<div class="ings-left inl"> <img src="images/scien-1.png"> </div>
<div class="ings-right inl">
<h2>L-Arginine</h2>
<p>A natural alpha amino-acid that acts as an hemodilator and
boosts the Nitric Oxide levels in your body - clearing up your cardio
system and opening it up to better absorb nutrients. The nitric oxide
synthase enzyme also improves vasodilation to prevent clogged arteries
(atherosclerosis), coronary artery disease, heart attacks and other
cardiovascular conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ings-left inl"> <img src="images/scien-2.png"> </div>
<div class="ings-right inl">
<h2>Milk Thistle (Silybum Marianum)</h2>
<p>One of nature’s most powerful antioxidants. It is a key element
in cell membranes and will keep toxins from getting inside liver cells.
Early laboratory studies suggest that silymarin and other active
substances in milk thistle may extend the lifespan of cells in your
body.</p>
</div>
<div class="ings-left inl"> <img src="images/scien-3.png"> </div>
<div class="ings-right inl">
<h2>Coleus Forskohlii</h2>
<p>The diterpenoids in coleonol (active compound) are a powerful
weight loss aid. Clinical studies show that it helps “melt” fatty tissue
faster and more efficiently. This unique nutrient is also known to be
used for people who suffer from insomnia and other sleep disorders as a
powerful relaxation aid.</p>
</div>
<div class="ings-left inl"> <img src="images/scien-4.png"> </div>
<div class="ings-right inl">
<h2>Eurycoma Longifolia (Penawar Pahit)</h2>
<p>This is one of Asia’s best kept secrets: Penawar is shown to
boost virility and libido. In addition to the aphrodisiac effects,
Eurycoma can also increase sperm production and may directly act as a
proerectile agent. At least one molecule in Eurycoma
(9-hydroxycanthin-6-one) is associated with both a delay in ejaculation
as well as pro-erectile properties.</p>

<h2>TESTING <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a></h2>
<h3 class="t1">Week One:</h3>
<p>After 1 week on the new routine, I was surprised
by how fast and dramatic the effects were. My energy level was up and I
wasn't as hungry as I usually was. This is a welcomed side effect of <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> and its power to curb appetite. I honestly felt fantastic and best of
all, I didn't have to change anything about my daily routine.</p>
<p>On Day 7, I got on the scale (this new digital scale that
measures muscle composition) and couldn't believe my eyes--I had
gained 3 lbs in muscle mass. But still I wasn't completely convinced.
They say that in the beginning of some muscle programs, you lose a lot
of water weight and gain a lot of muscle. I wanted to see if I would
still gain this much muscle in the upcoming weeks. But it sure was
looking up! I now weighed under 182 lbs for the first time in years!</p>
<h3 class="t2">Week Two:</h3>
<p>After 2 weeks of using the <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> I had more
energy and was sleeping more soundly than ever. I wasn't waking up in
the middle of the night or tossing and turning because my body was able
to relax (a result of the supplements' detoxifying properties, I think).
I also managed to shred down, putting me at an
unbelievable 150 lbs in just 2 weeks. I could also feel a 6-pack coming
through, which my girlfriend loved. Hell yeah!</p>
<p>At this point I started to put more faith in these muscle products as more than just a gimmick.</p>
<h3 class="t3">Week Three:</h3>
<p>After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticisms had
vanished! I had gained 12.5 lbs of pure muscle and trimmed down a lot. All the "love handles" on the sides of my stomach were completely gone. My
stomach was so defined I finally had a 6-pack! This product is
amazing. The muscle gains are UNREAL.</p>
<p>I still had a lot of energy as well. Usually around the third week of other diets you tend to run out of steam. But with <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> my energy levels didn't dip. Instead, they remained steady throughout
the day! I even noticed that my stomach was digesting food better, no
bloating or embarrassing gas after I ate.</p>
<h3 class="t4">Week Four:</h3>
<p>After the fourth week, I was completely shocked by
my final results. I gained an unbelievable 16 lbs of muscle mass since
starting the <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> routine! Everyone at Men's Health wants to try the diet now. I was ready and confident for the fitness competition. I am
definitely going to continue taking <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> because it produces consistent, amazing results and has so many other
muscle building compounds which help with muscle memory and maintaining
mass.</p>
<a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank"><img src="images/dadbod.png"></a>
<p class="cap"><strong>My Results:</strong> I lost visible fat &amp; built significant muscle in 30 days using <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a></p>

<p>Like everyone here at CNN, you might be doubtful about the effectivness of <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>. My advice is that you take advantage of this 30-day supply of <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a>.
Try it for yourself; the results are real. After conducting my personal
study, I am confident in recommending the product to any man who does
not have a healthy fat to muscle ratio. I have personally heard from
hundreds of men who are finding success with it (myself included). For a
limited time the makers of <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> are offering you order 2 bottles, and get 3, or order 3 bottles, and get 5. To order your bottle, follow the links I have provided & know that you are getting a quality product that works; on the best terms!</p>

<h1>Tom Lewis</h1>
<p>F*ck going to the gym. I used to spend weeks at a time &amp;
pay ridiculous amounts of money for a trainer... only to see minimal
gains. I worked my ass off ate healthy, slept well, &amp; exercised
daily, but nothing compares to <a href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=" target="_blank">Eternal Nutrition Muscle.</a> Seriously so happy I got turned on to this stuff. I'm a skeptic,
especaially with how much time i've spent trying to lose weight, but in
less than 4 weeks i lost 17lbs. Just thought I would share my experience
gonna try &amp; see if i can sign up for the extra bottles again before it ends
hahaha.</p>

<h1>Tim Porquez</h1>
<p> I am a personal trainer which means that I train people how
to lose the fat while maintaining their muscles. This is the reason why I
have beef with my people who use diet pills. Most diet pills burn
muscles in the process of burning fat. I like <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> due to the fact that it builds muscles, &amp; ALSO burns fat. I recommend it to the people I train.</p>

<h1>Jackson J.</h1>
<p>This is a fantastic awesome product. Over the years I have
tried protein, creatine, &amp; diet pills &amp; the only thing I
accomplished with them was to fill noxious every time I used them. <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> is the first product that has worked for me. I've put on a ton of muscle &amp; lost fat just like the article says.</p>

<p> The way <a target="_blank" href="{offer}&sub1=&sub2=&sub3=&click_id={subid}&sub4=">Eternal Nutrition Muscle</a> suppresses appetite is amazing. I still eat a good amount, but I don't have the cravings for junk food like I usually do.</p>
